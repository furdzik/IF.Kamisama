Write my own style guide CSS (like BEM, but better) - that’s why I need to learn:
English
CSS Documentation - W3C
BEM - understand
Other metodologies - understand
Understand what what is important for W3C, big and small companies, developers for a big/small projects
How to publish it on GitHub
How to add own rules or add new rules for cssLint etc.


Structure
Add CSS Lint for it, add folders, fils structure etc.
Naming convention (https://cssguidelin.es/#bem-like-naming)
BEM + SMACSS + OOCSS
Ask for advice -> Emilia, Monika, Patrycjusz
